# P14: HRNet App
WealthHealth is a large financial company that uses an in-house employee management application: HRnet. My main goal is to update HRnet and convert it to React. The old version uses 4 JQuery plugins : datetimepicker, jquery-modal, jquery-ui/selectmenu, DataTables.

My tasks was : 

- Convert the entire project to React
- Add a state management system
- Publish a React plugin to NPM : [My Package : Modal ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@killouh/modalpackage?activeTab=readme)
- Performance report between old and new version

# Create React App :
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App ](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

# Jquery to React Libs :
- [react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker)
- [react-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select)
- [Bootstrap => Table usage](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app)
- [ModalBymyOwn] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@killouh/modalpackage?activeTab=readme)

# Prerequisites :
- NodeJS
- Git
- A terminal to run commands. If you don't have one, I would recommend to use Visual Studio Code, it provides an integrated terminal inside the code editor.

git clone https://github.com/Killouh/P14---HrNet.git
